# Project Name: Surveys
# Description
```
Surveys is a stand alone Sinatra application built in the spirit of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA).
```
# Goals
```
Surveys is designed to be a small service able to integrate into several different projects. The original intent is for a larger Rails application that assists teachers with attendance, student success strategies tracking and research based predictive analytics to consume API data from surveys. Surveys has a table for questions, answers and question categories. It sends user Id, class ID and answer ID back to the main application, which in turn creates views for teachers in order to assist in education goals.
